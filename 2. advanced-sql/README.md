# My SQL Notes

## Introduction

Structured Query Language (SQL) is the language we use to interact with databases. A database is just a decent organization of data in a way it is easy to deal with. That 'organization' part is usually taken care of a special software normally called Database Management System. 

A schema is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema objects. Schema objects can be created and manipulated with SQL and include the following types of objects:

* **Tables** - row-column formatted unit of database
* **Constraints** - rules to govern/control data operations, ACID for example.
* **Indexes** - help in efficient data retrieval, searching specifically
* **Views** - a logical view of one or more tables, using subset of rows or columns, aggregations etcetera.
* **Synonyms** - alternative names/pointers to other schema objects, can be used for security purposes
* **Database links** - connections between two different database servers
* **Sequences** - used to create and manage unique sequences of numbers, autoincrement for example
* **Database triggers** - constructs that execute automatically on certain type of events, on/before/after
* **Stored functions, procedures, and packages** - DRY, packages are collection of PL/SQL codes
* **Materialized Views** - a materialized view for a complex query, maintained as specified refresh frequency



Other types of objects are also stored in the database and can be created and manipulated with SQL but are not contained in a schema:

* Tablespaces
* Users



These are my notes I prepared while taking [Orcale Master's Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-advanced/). It is really the most organized course to learn SQL.
