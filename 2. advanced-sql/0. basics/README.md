## Getting Started with SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is the language we use normally to communicate with databases. A database is just a decent organization of data in a way it is easy to interact with it. That 'organization' part is usually taken care of a special software normally called Database Managment System. 

A schema is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema objects. Schema objects can be created and manipulated with SQL and include the following types of objects:

* Tables and index-organized tables
* Indexes and index types
* Operators
* Views
* Synonyms
* Database links
* Sequences
* Database triggers
* Stored functions, procedures, and packages
* Materialized views and materialized view logs
* Object tables, object types, and object views
* Clusters
* Dimensions

Other types of objects are also stored in the database and can be created and manipulated with SQL but are not contained in a schema:

* Roles
* Tablespaces
* Users
* Contexts
* Directories
* Profiles
